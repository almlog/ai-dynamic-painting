# Claude Development Methodology for AI Dynamic Painting System

**Document Purpose**: Enable seamless high-quality development continuation with evidence-based practices and SuperClaude framework integration.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23  
**Success Reference**: T4B-002 (28/28 tests) and T4B-003 (8/8 tests) completion

---

## üéØ Core Development Philosophy

### Evidence-First Development
- **Zero Tolerance for False Reports**: All completion claims must be backed by verifiable evidence
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Screenshots, test outputs, and verification files are mandatory
- **Measure Twice, Cut Once**: Verify implementation before marking tasks complete

### SuperClaude Framework Integration
Every development session MUST start with appropriate SuperClaude flags to ensure quality and systematic approach.

---

## üöÄ Session Initialization Protocol

### 1. Mandatory SuperClaude Flag Usage
**Start every session with appropriate flags based on task type:**

```bash
# For task analysis and planning
SuperClaude --serena --think

# For complex debugging and problem solving  
SuperClaude --introspect --sequential --think

# For system integration and validation
SuperClaude --serena --validate --task-manage

# For architectural decisions
SuperClaude --think-hard --sequential
```

### 2. Context Loading Checklist
- [ ] Load project memory with `--serena` flag
- [ ] Review current task status in `specs/*/tasks.md`
- [ ] Check system state (backend/frontend running status)
- [ ] Verify test environment setup

### 3. Evidence Baseline Establishment
- [ ] Run existing tests to establish baseline: `npm test` and `pytest`
- [ ] Document current test counts and status
- [ ] Screenshot current system state if UI-related
- [ ] Record any existing issues or failures

## üìã TDD Implementation Standards

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle Enforcement

#### üî¥ RED Phase (Mandatory)
1. **Write Failing Test First**
   ```bash
   # Example verification command
   npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"
   # OR
   pytest tests/specific_test.py::test_name -v
   ```
2. **Document Test Failure**: Screenshot or copy test output
3. **Verify Test Legitimacy**: Ensure test fails for the right reason

#### üü¢ GREEN Phase (Evidence Required)
1. **Implement Minimum Code**: Only enough to make test pass
2. **Run Single Test**: Verify specific test now passes
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"
   pytest tests/specific_test.py::test_name -v
   ```
3. **Document Success**: Screenshot or copy passing test output

#### üîß REFACTOR Phase (Quality Gates)
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure no regressions
   ```bash
   npm test
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```
2. **Quality Checks**: Linting, type checking, etc.
3. **Document Final State**: Full test suite results

### Verification File Requirements
Create verification files for significant implementations:
- `verification_T[task-id]_[timestamp].md`
- Include: test outputs, screenshots, implementation evidence
- Store in `/home/aipainting/ai-dynamic-painting/docs/verifications/`

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gates System

### Pre-Completion Checklist (MANDATORY)
Before marking any task as complete, ALL items must be verified:

#### Code Quality Gates
- [ ] All new code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Test suite passes completely (document test count)
- [ ] No linting errors: `npm run lint` / `flake8 .`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `npm run type-check` / `mypy .`
- [ ] Code builds successfully: `npm run build` / `python -m build`

#### Functional Quality Gates  
- [ ] Feature works in development environment
- [ ] Integration points tested (API endpoints, UI components)
- [ ] Error handling verified with edge cases
- [ ] Performance acceptable (no obvious bottlenecks)

#### Documentation Quality Gates
- [ ] Implementation documented in relevant files
- [ ] API changes reflected in OpenAPI specs
- [ ] User-facing changes documented
- [ ] Verification file created with evidence

### Evidence Collection Standards
Every task completion MUST include:
1. **Test Output**: Complete test run results with pass/fail counts
2. **Functional Evidence**: Screenshots or API response samples
3. **Code Quality Evidence**: Linting and type checking results
4. **Integration Evidence**: System-level functionality proof

## üìä SuperClaude Agent Utilization

### Task-Specific Agent Selection

#### Analysis and Planning Tasks
**Agent**: `--serena --think`
**Use Cases**: Project status review, requirements analysis, planning
**Evidence**: Analysis documents, updated task files

#### Implementation Tasks  
**Agent**: `--serena --task-manage`
**Use Cases**: Code implementation, feature development
**Evidence**: Code changes, test results, functional verification

#### Debugging and Problem Solving
**Agent**: `--introspect --sequential --think`
**Use Cases**: Issue resolution, performance optimization
**Evidence**: Before/after comparisons, problem resolution documentation

#### System Integration
**Agent**: `--serena --validate --task-manage`
**Use Cases**: API integration, system testing, deployment
**Evidence**: Integration test results, system health checks

### Agent Effectiveness Monitoring
- Document which agent combinations work best for specific task types
- Track success rates with different flag combinations
- Continuously refine agent usage based on results

## ü§ù Gemini Collaboration Framework

### Role Distribution
- **Claude**: System architecture, complex problem solving, detailed implementation
- **Gemini**: Code generation, rapid prototyping, bulk modifications
- **Shared**: Code review, testing strategy, documentation

### Communication Protocols
- **Handoff Points**: Clear task boundaries and completion criteria
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress sharing through task file updates
- **Quality Assurance**: Cross-validation of critical implementations

### Conflict Resolution
- **Technical Disputes**: Evidence-based decision making
- **Approach Differences**: Document both approaches, test both if feasible
- **Quality Standards**: Higher standard always takes precedence

---

## üö® Anti-Pattern Prevention

### Forbidden Practices (Zero Tolerance)
1. **False Completion Reports**: Never mark tasks complete without verification
2. **Test Skipping**: Never disable or skip tests to claim completion
3. **Mock Success**: Never use fake data or mock results as completion proof
4. **Documentation Lag**: Never defer documentation updates
5. **Quality Compromise**: Never sacrifice quality for speed

### Warning Signs Recognition
- Claims of completion without test evidence
- Vague descriptions of implementation details
- Missing verification files for significant changes
- Test count decreases without explanation
- Documentation inconsistent with implementation

### Corrective Actions
- Immediately request evidence for any completion claims
- Run verification commands independently
- Create verification files for all significant work
- Document any discrepancies found

## üìà Success Metrics Tracking

### Quantitative Measures
- Test pass rates (aim for 100% before completion)
- Test coverage percentages
- Code quality scores (linting, type checking)
- Build success rates

### Qualitative Measures
- Implementation completeness
- Documentation accuracy
- Code maintainability
- System reliability

### Success Pattern Recognition
**T4B-002 Success Pattern** (28/28 tests):

**T4B-003 Success Pattern** (8/8 tests):
- Built on solid foundation from previous task
- Used existing patterns and infrastructure
- Maintained test discipline throughout
- Documented implementation thoroughly
