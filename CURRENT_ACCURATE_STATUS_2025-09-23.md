## üîç Evidence Files (Preserved for Verification)

### Verified Test Results:
- `/docs/claude_tasks/T4B-002_REVERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md`
  - **Frontend Unit Tests**: 28/28 passing (100%)
  - Complete test file contents and execution logs included

- `/docs/claude_tasks/T4C-001_FINAL_FIX_HISTORY_DISPLAY.md`  
  - **E2E Tests**: 7/7 passing (100%)
  - Dynamic history system implementation details included

### Technical Implementation:
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - API client with full TypeScript types
- `frontend/src/ai/components/AIGenerationDashboard.tsx` - Integrated UI component
- `frontend/tests/e2e/test_full_generation_flow.spec.ts` - E2E test suite
- `frontend/tests/ai/AIGenerationDashboard.test.tsx` - Unit test suite

## üöÄ System Status

### Currently Running (Should verify tomorrow):
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI with Admin endpoints)
- **Frontend UI**: http://localhost:5173 (React with integrated API client)
- **Database**: SQLite with generation history support

### Key Files Updated Today:
- `README.md` - Corrected test results and status
- `NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_TASKS.md` - Updated with verified completion status
- `TOMORROW_PRIORITIES_GEMINI.md` - Created action plan for next development phase

## üìã Recommendations for Tomorrow's Development

### Phase Decision Required:
**Option A**: Phase 5 - Hardware Integration (M5STACK + Raspberry Pi)
**Option B**: Phase 6 - Real VEO API Integration (Production deployment)

### Immediate Actions:
1. Verify systems still running (Backend:8000, Frontend:5173)
2. Choose next development phase based on project priorities
3. Use Spec Kit tools (`/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`) for structured development
4. Maintain TDD and evidence-based development practices

## üßπ Documentation Cleanup Completed

### Archived Files:
- Moved outdated completion reports to `/docs/archive_2025-09/`
- Preserved accurate verification evidence files
- Updated main documentation with verified status

### Removed False Claims:
- Corrected "27/28" to "28/28" unit test success rate
- Added verification markers to completion claims
- Ensured all status reports match actual test evidence
