  "generated_prompt": "## Video Generation Prompt: Tokyo Rain Night\n\n**Concept:** A mesmerizing 4K timelapse showcasing the tranquil beauty of a Tokyo living room at night, subtly interwoven with the ambiance of a light rain.  The video aims for a continuous loop suitable for ambient relaxation.\n\n**Scene:**  A modern, minimalist Tokyo living room bathed in the soft glow of warm, indirect lighting.  Rain gently falls outside, visible through a large window.  Focus subtly shifts between details: the play of light on polished wood surfaces, the gentle sway of a nearby plant, the subtle reflections of city lights on wet glass.\n\n**Visual Style:**  Employ a cinematic, slow-motion aesthetic.  Use a gentle, desaturated color palette with muted blues, grays, and warm oranges reflecting the twilight hour and the rain-soaked city outside.  Incorporate subtle bokeh effects and shallow depth of field to enhance the dreamy atmosphere.  The overall feel should evoke a sense of peaceful contemplation and quietude.\n\n**Audio:**  Ambient sounds of light rain, distant city sounds (muted), and potentially subtle, minimalist ambient music are included to create an immersive soundscape.  The audio should be perfectly balanced to complement the visuals without being overpowering.\n\n**Duration:** 45 seconds loop.\n\n**Technical Specifications:** 4K resolution, 24fps,  H.264 codec.\n\n**Weather Integration:** The rain's rhythm and the subtle reflections of light on wet surfaces should be a key element, visually communicating the 23.29Â°C, 70% humidity, light rain conditions of Tokyo on September 19th, 2025 at 23:37.\n\n\n**Keywords:** Tokyo, rain, night, living room, ambient, relaxation, minimalist, 4K, timelapse, cinematic, loop, cozy, peaceful.\n",
