  "prompt": "## Video Generation Prompt: Tokyo Rain Night\n\n**Concept:** A mesmerizing 4K video showcasing a serene living room ambiance in Tokyo on a soft rain night. The video aims to evoke a feeling of calm and relaxation, perfect for continuous background display.\n\n**Scene:** A modern, minimalist living room in Tokyo, subtly illuminated by warm, indirect lighting.  Focus is on atmospheric details: the gentle patter of rain against a large window overlooking the city lights, subtly blurred for a dreamy effect.  A single, elegant bonsai tree sits in the foreground, possibly illuminated by a small lamp.\n\n**Visual Style:**  Employ a cinematic, slightly desaturated color palette, leaning towards warm blues and muted oranges, reflecting the city lights and the rainy night.  The overall aesthetic should be calm and artistic, utilizing slow camera pans and subtle focus shifts.  Incorporate delicate particle effects subtly simulating rain droplets on the windowpane.  Consider a slight bokeh effect to enhance the dreamlike quality.\n\n**Audio:**  Subtle ambient sounds of light rain, distant city noises, and perhaps a minimalist piano melody playing softly in the background.  The audio should be carefully balanced to maintain a peaceful and calming atmosphere.\n\n**Technical Specifications:**\n\n* **Resolution:** 4K (3840x2160)\n* **Frame Rate:** 24fps\n* **Duration:** 45 seconds\n* **Style:** Cinematic, Minimalist, Ambient\n* **Mood:** Calm, Relaxing, Serene\n\n**Meta-data:**  Include timestamp (2025-09-19T23:41) and location (Tokyo) subtly within the video, perhaps as a faint reflection in the window or subtly incorporated into the UI design if a minimalist UI is added.\n\n**Additional Notes:** The video should loop seamlessly.  Avoid any jarring transitions or abrupt changes in lighting or sound. The goal is to create a continuously soothing and visually pleasing experience.\n",
